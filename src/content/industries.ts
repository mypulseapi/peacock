 * Sector pages, rewritten against what this product actually is.
 *
 * The previous set was ten sectors inherited from the "personalization for
 * everything" positioning: social networking, blogs, streaming, news media and
 * edtech alongside the commerce ones. None of those five has a product
 * catalogue, and a Decision Audit measures product data. The copy showed it,
 * promising feed personalization, lookalike audiences, vouchers and native
 * Shopify and Magento SDKs, none of which we build.
 *
 * So the set is six, and every one of them is somewhere a catalogue exists and
 * a buyer makes a comparison against recorded attributes. The retired slugs
 * redirect to /industries rather than 404, since they were in the sitemap.
 *
 * Each sector carries its own `attributes`, which drive the page's figure. They
 * are illustrative of the shape of that sector's catalogue, and the page says
 * so: the only measured numbers on this site come from the laptop shelf, and
 * they live on /why/method where they can be reproduced.
