/*
 * `output: "export"` has no request to generate this on, so it must be generated at build time.
 * Next requires that to be stated rather than inferred, because the alternative -- a route that
 * wants to be dynamic in a build that cannot be -- is a silent 404 on the deployed site.
 *
 * There is no `lastModified` on any entry, and that is deliberate.
 *
 * It used to be `new Date()`, stamped onto all 100 URLs on every build. That is not what the field
 * means: it claims each page changed when the site was last deployed, so a deploy that touched one
 * blog post told Google that the terms, the privacy policy and every product page changed too.
 * `reference/seo_and_aeo_engineering_standard.md` says it outright: "`lastmod` must be a real
 * modification date or be omitted entirely; a `lastmod` that updates on every deploy is ignored by
 * Google after it is caught lying twice."
 *
 * Omitted is the honest option here. These pages are built from TypeScript content modules rather
 * than from one file per page, so there is no per-page date to read: the blog's ten articles live
 * in `content/blog.ts`, and a git date for that file is the date of the most recent article, not
 * of each one. The handbook is the opposite case, one `.mdx` per page, and it reads a real git
 * date per file.
