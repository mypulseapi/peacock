/**
 * The notes.
 *
 * What was here before was five posts of invented statistics: "31% average lift
 * in first-time visitor conversion", "45% increase in average order value",
 * "2x improvement in product discovery". None of those was measured, by us or
 * by anybody, and they sat on the same site as /why/limits, which says in as
 * many words that we have no uplift figure. That is the contradiction a careful
 * buyer finds, and once they find it nothing else on the site survives it.
 *
 * So every number in these ten pieces is somebody else's published research,
 * attributed inline and linked in `sources`. Where a figure comes from a vendor
 * rather than from independent research, the sentence says so, because a vendor
 * reporting on the thing it sells is a different class of evidence.
 *
 * The only first-party figures are the laptop shelf: 216 products, 32 stated
 * requirements, 94 unresolved, 161 of 216 recoverable from titles. Those are
 * reproducible from the repository with the command on /why/method, and they
 * are always labelled as ours.
 *
 * Written in English only. These are articles rather than interface copy, and a
 * Vietnamese headline over an English body is worse than leaving it in English.
 */
/**
 * Charts are blocks, not decoration bolted on afterwards.
 *
 * Every one carries its own source, because a chart without an attribution is
 * the same problem the old posts had. The form is chosen per job: bar for
 * magnitude across categories, dumbbell for a before and after on one measure,
 * waffle for a share of a whole, trend for change over time, figure for a
 * single number that is not a chart at all.
