/**
 * The three steps, as markup rather than as the exported SVG figure.
 *
 * The export drew the rail, the labels, the titles and the bodies inside three `foreignObject`
 * blocks, which fixed their order: label, title, body, and nowhere for an illustration to go. The
 * order here is rail, then illustration, then the words, and that cannot be expressed without
 * taking the pieces out of the drawing. It is also where the empty band under this section came
 * from: each block reserved 286 units of a 330-unit viewBox while the words filled about 130.
 *
 * Nothing is retyped to do it. The copy is still the figure's own `text.json`, keyed per step and
 * already carrying both locales, so `/vi` reads exactly as it did when the SVG rendered it.
 *
 * The illustrations are this page's own, and they are the three steps rather than the audit's:
 * a category being exported again with its progress part-way, the same attributes set before
 * against after, and the coverage that moved with the report it comes back in.
 *
 * 26 Oct 2026, the owner: laid out as the zig-zag of the newer product pages (`steps-zigzag.tsx`),
 * one row per step with its number large, instead of three columns on a rail. The three pictures are
 * the owner's transparent versions (28 Oct 2026), 3 : 2, on the Decision Audit's picture panel
 * (`how-glow` on `surface-1`), which follows the theme, in the same full-width 3 : 2 box as the other
 * product pages' steps (`Picture` in chapters.tsx). The white plate the opaque ones needed is gone.
