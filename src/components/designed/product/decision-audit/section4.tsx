/**
 * The three steps, as markup rather than as the exported SVG figure.
 *
 * The export drew the rail, the labels, the titles and the bodies inside three `foreignObject`
 * blocks, which fixed their order: label, title, body, and nowhere for an illustration to go. The
 * order here is rail, then illustration, then the words, and that cannot be expressed without
 * taking the pieces out of the drawing. It is also where the empty band under this section came
 * from: each block reserved 286 units of a 330-unit viewBox while the words filled about 130.
 *
 * Nothing is retyped to do it. The copy is still the figure's own `text.json`, keyed per step and
 * already carrying both locales, so `/vi` reads exactly as it did when the SVG rendered it.
 *
 * The illustrations are this page's own: they show a catalogue arriving as CSV and JSON, the
 * attributes being measured, and the ranked report that comes back, which is this page's three
 * steps and not the verification page's.
 *
 * 26 Oct 2026, the owner: laid out as the zig-zag of the newer product pages (`steps-zigzag.tsx`),
 * one row per step with its number large, instead of three columns on a rail. The three are different shapes
 * (514x836, 489x670, 486x920), so each sits centred in a fixed band rather than sized by width.
