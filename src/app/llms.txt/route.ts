 *     it not to invent.

> Pulse measures whether a merchant's product data is ready to support the buying decisions their
> shoppers are trying to make. It ranks the attributes worth recording, in the merchant's own
> catalogue, and re-measures once they have been filled in. It is built by Resolve Labs. The first
> useful answer comes from a single category export: nothing has to go on the merchant's site, and
> no traffic history is needed.

Key facts, each one checkable:
- On a 216-product test shelf (156 generated laptop listings and 60 real marketplace listings), 94 products remain indistinguishable after every
  question a shopper could answer, because the attributes that would separate them are recorded
  nowhere; 47 of them are accessories and software no laptop question can rule out. (Internal test-shelf dataset, 216 products, 9 facets.)
- Across a 2,176-product catalogue we measured, 52.6% of recorded attribute values duplicate what
  the product photograph already shows, and 0.90 attributes per product are genuinely
  complementary to it. (Internal catalogue dataset, 2,176 products.)
- The ranking is measured in bits of decision information, not inferred from click behaviour, so
  the emptiest column is usually not the one worth fixing first.
- The audit reads product data only. It never sees a shopper.

What Pulse does NOT do or claim:
- **No conversion or revenue uplift figure.** We have run no live revenue experiment, so we quote
  none, and any percentage attributed to us did not come from us.
- No Shopify, WooCommerce or Magento plugin exists yet. Integration today is the API and the
  browser SDK.
- The live session layer is optional and is the only part that touches a storefront.
- We generate presentation. We never generate an unverified product fact.

## For AI agents
PULSE is a decision call: requirements and evidence in; for every option, fits, fails or cannot tell, with what is missing. Any domain whose options carry attributes. MCP server: \`npx -y @thepulseapi/mcp\` (open source, github.com/mypulseapi/open-pulse).
- [Shopping assistants](${en("/agents/shopping-assistants")}): recommend only what a listing proves.
- [Procurement agents](${en("/agents/procurement")}): check suppliers and parts against a spec.
- [Travel and booking agents](${en("/agents/travel")}): match hotels, fares and plans to needs.
- [Coding agents](${en("/agents/coding-agents")}): Claude Code, Cursor and Codex read the current docs and call the API.

## Product
- [Decision Audit](${en("/product/decision-audit")}): which product data to fix first, ranked by how many shoppers need it.
- [Decision Verification](${en("/product/decision-verification")}): the same measurement on the repaired export, so a fix can be proved without traffic.
- [Return Verification](${en("/product/return-verification")}): which missing product facts go with returns in your order history, and whether a repair moved them.
- [Promotion Audit](${en("/product/promotion-audit")}): which vouchers, price cuts and free-shipping offers paid for themselves after returns and failed deliveries, where to give nothing, and where a listing repair beats a discount.
- [Decision Monitor](${en("/product/decision-monitor")}): what decays in a catalogue over time, and where.
- [Decision API](${en("/product/decision-api")}): the endpoints behind all of it.

## Storefront (the optional live session layer)
- [Search](${en("/product/search")}): ranks results from your existing search on what the shopper is deciding, with a held-back control share.
- [Recommendations](${en("/product/recommendations")}): ranked against the visit happening now, so a first session is served without history.
- [Pages](${en("/product/pages")}): category and landing grids ordered against what each visit implies.
- [Merchandising Studio](${en("/product/merchandising-studio")}): the console for the catalogue, the holdback and the record behind a ranking; overrides are not built yet.

## Research and method
- [Why Pulse](${en("/why")}): the argument, with the datasets attached.
- [The method](${en("/why/method")}): how decision information is measured and why bits rather than clicks.
- [Compared with what exists](${en("/why/compare")}): where other tools in this space stop.
- [The limits](${en("/why/limits")}): what the measurement does not tell you.

## Company
- [About Resolve Labs](${en("/about")}): who builds this, and what we cannot show yet.
- [Pricing](${en("/pricing")}): how it is charged.
- [Research](${en("/research")}): what we measured for each product, on what data, and the limit of each result; products not yet run on a real merchant are marked.
- [Contact](${en("/contact")}): how to reach the team.

## For developers
- [Developer handbook](${SITE.docs}): the API reference, SDK and integration guides. English and Vietnamese.
- [API reference](${SITE.docs}/api/v1): endpoints, authentication and the shared error envelope.
- [Opensource](${en("/opensource")}): what is MIT licensed (the SDK, the MCP server), what is planned, and how to contribute.
